# SING: Symbol-to-Instrument Neural Generator

SING is a deep learning based music notes synthetizer that can be trained on the
 [NSynth dataset][nsynth].
Despite being 32 times faster to train and 2,500 faster for inference,
SING produces audio with significantly improved perceptual quality compared to
the NSynth wavenet-like autoencoder [[1]](#ref_nsynth) as measured by
Mean Opinion Scores based on human evaluations.

The architecture and results obtained are detailed in our paper
[SING: Symbol-to-Instrument Neural Generator][sing_nips].
SING is based on a LSTM based sequence generator and a
convolutional decoder:

## Requirements

SING works with python3.6 and newest.
To use SING, you must have decently recent version of the following
package installed:

- numpy
- requests
- pytorch (needs to be >= 4.1.0 as we use torch.stft)
- scipy
- tqdm

If you have anaconda installed, you can run from the root of this repository:

    conda env update
    conda activate sing

This will create a `sing` environmnent with all the dependencies installed.
Alternatively, you can use pip to install those:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt


SING can optionally be installed using the usual `setup.py`
although this is not required.

### Obtaining the NSynth dataset

If you want to train SING from scratch, you will need a copy of the NSynth
dataset [[1]](#ref_nsynth). To download it, you use the following instructions
(WARNING, NSynth is 30GB so this will take a bit of time):

    mkdir data && cd data &&\
    wget http://download.magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth/nsynth-train.jsonwav.tar.gz &&\
    tar xf nsynth-train.jsonwav.tar.gz


## Using SING

Once installed or from the root of this repository, you can use a family
of commands detailed hereafter of the form

    python3 -m sing.*


### Common flags

For either training or generation, use the `--cuda` flag for GPU acceleration
and `--parallel` flag to use all available GPUs. Depending on the memory
and number of GPUs available, consider tweaking the batch size using the
`--batch-size` flag. The default is 64 but 256 was used in the paper.


### Training

If you already have the NSynth dataset downloaded somewhere, run

    python3 -m sing.train [--cuda [--parallel]] --data PATH_TO_NSYNTH \
        --output PATH_TO_SING_MODEL [--checkpoint PATH_TO_CHECKPOINTS]

`PATH_TO_NSYNTH` is by default set to `data/nsynth-train`.
The final model will be saved at `PATH_TO_SING_MODEL`. If you want
to save checkpoints after each epoch, or to resume a previously interrupted
training, use the `--checkpoint` option.

By default, `PATH_TO_NSYNTH` is set to `data` and `PATH_TO_SING_MODEL`
is set to `models/sing.th`.

### Generation

For generation, you do not need the NSynth dataset but you should have a trained SING model.

    python3 -m sing.generate [--cuda [--parallel]] \
        --model PATH_TO_SING_MODEL PATH_TO_ITEM_LIST

`PATH_TO_ITEM_LIST` should be a file with one dataset item name per list,
for instance `organ_electronic_044-055-127`.

Alternatively, you can download a pretrained model using

    python3 -m sing.generate [--cuda [--parallel]] --dl PATH_TO_ITEM_LIST

By default, the model will be downloaded under `models/sing.th` but a
different path can be provided using the `--model` option.
The pretrained model can be directly download [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sing-models/sing.th).

### Results reproduction

To reproduce the results of Table 1 in our paper, simply run

```bash
# For the L1 spectral losss
python3 -m sing.train [--cuda [--parallel]] --l1
# For the L1 spectral loss without time embeddings
python3 -m sing.train [--cuda [--parallel]] --l1 --time-dim=0
# For the Wav loss
python3 -m sing.train [--cuda [--parallel]] --wav
```

To reproduce the audio samples used for the human evaluations, simply run
from the root of the git repository

    python3 -m sing.generate [--cuda [--parallel]] --dl nsynth_100_test.txt

The file `nsynth_100_test.txt` has been generated using the following code:

```python
from sing import nsynth
from sing.fondation.datasets import RandomSubset
dset = nsynth.get_nsynth_metadata()
train, valid, test = nsynth.make_datasets(dset)

evaluation = RandomSubset(test, 100)
open("nsynth_100_test.txt", "w").write("\n".join(
    evaluation[i].metadata['name'] for i in range(len(evaluation))))
```

## Generated audio

A comparison of audio samples generated by SING and the NSynth Wavenet based autoencoder [[1]](#ref_nsynth)
is available on [the paper webpage](https://research.fb.com/publications/sing-symbol-to-instrument-neural-generator).
